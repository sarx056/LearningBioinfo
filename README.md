## A note to anyone who may tumble across this lame repository: 

I had become interested in this subject increasingly throughout my college years and also cuz its a necessary skill for anyone in life sciences academia or industry. I've created this repository to log my journey :P 

I've googled *extensively* to find good and valid resources to self learn bioinformatics and mainly came across Ossu's bioinformatics course, sandbox.bio, EMBL,  Rosalind(find links below) and also many people have suggested O'reilly's books for learning programming, hence i'm using them as my main source to study. 


I have already taken some of the courses/subjects listed in Ossu so i'll be modifying the course list a little here:  

### Year 1 
-CS 1 Python 1 

-CS 1 Principles of computing 1 

-CS 2 Python 2 

-CS 2 principles of computing 2 

-Introduction to Probability and Data (with R)

### Year 2 
-Algorithmic Thinking 1 

-Mathematics for CS 

-Biostatistics 1 

-Introduction to linux 

-Inferential Statistics (with R)

-IBM data science - python project for data science


### Year 3
-Algorithmic Thinking 2 

-Differential equations (khan academy) 

-Biostatistics 2 

-Linear Regression and Modeling (with R)

-Bayesian Statistics (with R)

-IMB data science - data analysis with python 

### Year 4 
-Harvardx data science 

-IMB data science - data visualzization with python

-Bioinformatics 1 to 7 

### Extra 
-evolution 

-genomic data science specialization

-using python for research
