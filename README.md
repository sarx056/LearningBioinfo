# LearningBioinfo
Learning bioinformatics from scratch as a complete noob 

## A note to anyone who may tumble across this lame repository: 

I had become interested in this subject increasingly throughout my college years and also cuz its a necessary skill for anyone in life sciences academia or industry. I've created this repository to log my journey :P 

I've googled *extensively* to find good and valid resources to self learn bioinformatics and mainly came across Ossu's bioinformatics course, Rosalind and also many people have suggested O'reilly's books for learning programming, hence i'm using them as my main source to study. 

I have already taken some of the courses/subjects listed in Ossu so i'll be modifying the course list a little here to follow in my own may:
